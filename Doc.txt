How It Works

    BLE Shield communicates with Arduino through the ACI (Application Controller Interface). The ACI is similar to SPI but does not actually work as SPI. SPI is consist of MOSI, MISO, SCK and SS, whereas ACI is consist of MOSI, MISO, SCK, REQN and RDYN.
    Since BLE Shield may receive data anytime even not selected by SPI master (Arduino), so the SS line is not needed.
    In ACI,data exchanged still through MOSI and MISO, and SCK provides the clock generated by master.
    When master wants to request data from BLE Shield, it puts the REQN to low until RDYN line is put to low by BLE Shield, and then master generates the clock to read out the data. After reading out the data, master will release the REQN and BLE Shield release the RDYN, put them to high.
    If BLE Shield has data to transmit to master, it will put the RDYN to low to indicate master, even though master havn't requested data and REQN is idle. If master detectes a low level condition on RDYN, it will put REQN to low and generate the clock to read out the data.After reading out the data, both REQN and RDYN will be put to high.Note that REQN is controlled by master while RDYN is controlled by BLE Shield.
